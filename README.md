# Airplane Model controlled Ps2 Joystick
Sorry for the unprofessionality, it was a project done a long time ago. It's a model to use in RC 433 MHZ module, control using PS2 joystick and servo motor.
I couldn't use the servo library at the same time with RC 433 MHZ module library, so i programmed it.
This project has no professional intentions.

**I don't have the most part of the code of the process, sorry about that!**

## Libraries
[This is the PS2 joystick library](https://github.com/DonCabin/AirplaneModelPs2Joystick/blob/master/PS2X_lib.zip)
