# Airplane Model controlled Ps2 Joystick
Sorry for the unprofessionality, it was a project done a long time ago. It's a model to use in RC 433 MHZ module, control using PS2 joystick and servo motor.
I couldn't use the servo library at the same time with RC 433 MHZ module library, so i programmed it.
This project has no professional intentions.
